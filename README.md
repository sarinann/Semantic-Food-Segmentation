# Semantic-Food-Segmentation
This project aimed to develop a deep-learning model for semantic food segmentation.

Semantic segmentation visualizes the information about the various image regions by analyzing the images and videos fed to the model on a pixel level. Food segmentation is crucial for developing and understanding the different food regions within the given input and is used in applications such as contamination and quantity detection. The report provides an overview of the project’s problem statement, the work behind building and training the models, testing and validation of the datasets and the evaluation of the model’s performance.
